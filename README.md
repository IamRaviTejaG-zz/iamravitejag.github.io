Needs a lot of fixes! Here are the known problems:

1. The images do not scale as expected on mobile devices. Infact, they do not even show up on my phone with 5.5" FHD display.
2. The footer (the copyright text) does not show up on the bottom right side on all resolutions. This has something to do with the *br* tags mostly. Need to find an alternative for vertical spacing instead of using *br* tags.
